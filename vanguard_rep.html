						<h1>Vanguard and Faction Rep and Marks</h1>

							<!--Insert MD class from Reddit post-->
							<div class="md">
							<p>First and most important, marks can ONLY, ONLY be obtained once you hit lvl 18.  And even then, they only really start to kick in once you hit lvl 20.</p>
							<p>18 is the minimum, 20 is when you want to start focusing on getting them, as that's when they become more widely available.</p>
							<hr>
							
							<p><strong>Vanguard and Faction Rep</strong></p>
							<p>Before level 20, you will only receive Vanguard reputation for EVERY patrol you do.  Usually +10 rep.  You will also receive rep for completing Strikes and handing in bounties (bounties unlock at lvl 4, consisting of "kill 100 enemies without dying" or "complete X strike" or "get X amount of precision kills - aka headshots - etc).</p>
							<p>However, once you hit level 20, you can buy a class-specific faction item that you can equip whenever you want, that CONVERTS that Vanguard rep into that faction's rep.</p>
							<p>So if I go do a patrol mission at lvl 20, with no faction gear on for my Warlock, I will receive +10 Vanguard rep.  Great.  If I do a strike, I get Vanguard rep.  Great.</p>
							<p>Now, if I head to, say, Future War Cult faction, and buy their Warlock bond item that can only be bought at lvl 20 (same for every class), with no rep requirements, EVERY time I do anything that would have gotten me Vanguard rep, like patrols or strikes, will gain me Future War Cult rep instead.</p>
							<p>I WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE VANGUARD REP, AS LONG AS I AM WEARING THE FACTION ITEM AT THE TIME I GET THE REP.</p>
							<p>If I un-equip said bond, for my Warlock, I will gain Vanguard rep again.</p>
							<hr>
							
							<p><strong>Marks</strong></p>
							<p>Marks are needed to purchase  Vanguard weapons, armor and resources from Vanguard vendors.  You are limited to 100 marks per week and inventory cap of 200.  Marks can only be obtained via strikes.</p>
							<hr>
							
							<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
							<p>Materials found in the world during missions or patrols.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Spinmetal on Earth</li>
									<li>Helium vials on Moon</li>
									<li>Sprit Bloom on Venus</li>
									<li>Relic Iron on Mars</li>
								</ul>
							<p>Materials can be traded in to a quartermaster for PVP or PVE once you have 50 of the material of your choice.</p>
							Once you have 50 of, say, Spinmetal from Earth, you can run to EITHER the Crucible quartermaster in the Tower opposite the Crucible Master...guy...OR to the Vanguard quartermaster near the ship/dock area.</p>
							<p>Depending on who you go to, you will get EITHER rep or marks (marks now confirmed) for Vanguard/your faction or Crucible, and glimmer, for trading in 50 materials of your choice.  I think it's random as to whether you get rep or marks, but it may transpire that certain materials give a higher guarantee of one or the other, we don't know yet and testing will need to be done.</p>
							<p>[Edit] See above under the marks section for handing in materials to quartermasters - seems like you can get marks this way as well.</p>
							<hr>
							<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
							<p>So, here goes:</p>
							<p><strong>The best way to farm rep</strong> </p>
							<p>Patrols and bounties as they're quick and easy, can be repeated however many times you want, and you can also simultaneously collect materials which can be traded in for rep and marks, AS WELL as doing the daily and weekly heroics that requires a fireteam already set up, otherwise you just go in alone and it's impossible (which gives you varying rep around the same value as a bounty).</p>
							<p><strong>The best way to farm marks</strong> </p>
							<p>Complete Strike Playlists that you can comfortably complete with your gear, trading in materials, as well as doing the daily and weekly challenges (and the weekly challenge gives you strange coins for use of buying black market gear every weekend).</p>
